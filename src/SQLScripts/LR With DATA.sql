 ('9742','Version One Ltd, United Kingdom - [9531]','711179','Enterprise-wide Electronic Funds Transfer Solution','The Enterprise-wide Electronic Funds Transfer Solution BACSTEL-IP By transferring funds electronically with DbBACS, routine business administration tasks can be streamlined, and valuable savings of time and money can now be made. Secure electronic funds transfer is of ultimate importance for any organisation today, and peace of mind comes from having secure, efficient systems, which ensure that fraud is eliminated. Tightly integrated into SAP, DbBACS is highly secure, proven and very easy to use. Automated electronic payments and collections include: ? Supplier payments ? Salaries & wages ? Direct debits Improved Business Efficiency DbBACS users report greatly increased efficiency throughout the organisation, as traditional methods of funds transfer are now streamlined by using e-commerce solutions. A true multi-user system, DbBACS enables any number of authorised users to process BACS transmissions directly from their own desktop. Time Savings Substantial time savings are achieved, with no more cheques to print, sign or post. Just a few mouse-clicks and all payments, etc. will be automatically sent electronically - in seconds. For easier reconciliation, only one entry per transmission appears on the bank statement. Cost Savings Vastly reduce administrative and management costs, as well as bank charges. Postage and handling costs are eliminated, as is expensive pre-printed cheque stationery. As a result of implementing DbBACS, users find it much easier to negotiate increased supplier discounts because of more efficient funds transfer. For multi-site organisations, authorised users can submit BACS transmissions through one central BACS server engine - dramatically reducing costs whilst providing greater security and simplifying support. Security Eliminating cheques also eliminates the possibility of internal and external cheque fraud. Vastly improve security by restricting access to confidential & sensitive information. User-profiling offers the facility to enable one user to prepare a submission, one to queue it ready for transmission and yet another to action it with a BACS password. The system automatically blocks transmissions where individual record or transmission totals exceed pre-defined values for the specified profile. Full audit trails are provided for total peace of mind. Fast Payback The dramatic savings in transaction charges, stationery and labour costs mean that DbBACS typically pays for itself in just a few months. Automatically sending out the associated remittance advices with other products from Version One\' s suite of e-business software modules - DbFax and DbMail - will provide even greater savings. Tightly integrated into SAP Accounting and ERP systems, DbBACS offers the following: ? Available on UNIX, Windows NT and Windows 2000 platforms. ? A true enterprise-wide solution that can be invoked from any authorised workstation on the network. ? Multiple connection methods including ISDN and BT Dialplus. ? Automatic invoking from within core business applications. ? Supports Euros for European & global transmissions. ? Highly configurable. ? Approved by BACS to the highest level. ? Configurable profiles enabling users to have different authorisation levels and pre/post transmission procedures and reports. ? Account & Sort Code modulus validation. ? Optional Industry Sort Code Directory validation. ? Automatic archiving of all transactions. ? Audit log of all actions, submissions & configuration changes. ? Bureau transmission facility. ?

 ('9741','Version One Ltd, United Kingdom - [9531]','711179','Secure Cheque Printing Solution','Secure Cheque Printing Solution The Version One Secure Cheque Printing Solution consists of an output management system and a specially adapted laser printer with additional security features. The printer uses MICR toner so that even the magnetic numbering on the cheques can be added at print time. The cheque stationery can be produced to your precise specifications, by a specialist cheque printing company. The range of anti-fraud devices incorporated into the stationery exceeds the requirements of APACS (the UK banking standards body). Apart from a logo, watermark and hologram, the cheques are effectively blank, so the same stationery may be used for any number of bank accounts with multiple banks. With most applications, the Version One software is invisible to the end-user. Cheques are produced either by printing the standard accounting system output to a new ?virtual? printer on the network or by generating a file containing the details for the cheque in a designated directory on the network. DbChequePrint runs ?behind the scenes? on the server to reformat the standard output, to add graphics, etc and to direct the output to the appropriate printer(s). There is usually no need for any manual intervention. The special fonts and any signatures will normally be stored inside the printer itself and will not be available on the network, even to administrators. No software, fonts or printer devices are required to be installed on client PCs for users to be able to print cheques. For reasons of security, DbForm does not allow any ad hoc cheque printing outside of the core applications. For more complex requirements, DbChequePrint incorporates a sophisticated programming environment, which allows the standard output to be reformatted. For example: cheques may be pre-sorted prior to printing, e.g. high value cheques printed separately. High-value cheques may be printed with one signature and a dotted line or no signature at all so that they may be manually signed. Cheques may be routed to different printers or stationery, e.g. low-value cheques to pressure-seal stationery, high-value to standard A4 sheets. The continuation pages of remittance advices may use a different layout and/or different stationery from a different paper tray or a different printer. Activity reports can be automatically sent to other printers. Output may be automatically archived to Version One?s DbArchive or other document management system (the cheque portion can be voided or omitted completely from the archived document). The DbChequePrint system may be used - with no additional software costs - to generate other documents from your SAP finance systems or other software, such as payroll. For example, hundreds of our customers use the same software to generate BACS remittance advices, Giro credits, purchase orders, invoices and credit notes, debtor statements, reminder letters, direct debit mandates and customised reports.','www.versionone.co.uk','mySAP All-in-One','4.6C, 4.7, 4.7C','2004 B','3+ reference customers','All - Cross Industry',NULL,'6-Not Applicable','9-Pending SAP Review',NULL,NULL,'Australia, South Africa, United Kingdom','50 to 100 employees , 100 to 250 employees , 250 to 500 employees , Over 500 employees','Logistics - Inventory Management, Logistics - Procurement, Logistics - Production, Logistics - Sales','English',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'100',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Yes',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'C','Windows XP/200X, Windows Server, Solaris, Linux-Server, Linux-Desktop, HP-UX, IBM AIX, SGI Irix, Unix Freeform Version',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'No',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'5-Apr-06',NULL,'Angela.Slattery','4/5/2006 9:28','Angela.Slattery','4/5/2006 9:28','Yes','<PRE> Return-Path: <system@ramius.net> Message-Id: <24970181.1144244105242.JavaMail.root@web011.sap.communityzero.com> Date: Wed, 5 Apr 2006 09:35:05 -0400 (EDT) From: null<system@ramius.net> To: joerg.graf@sap.com Subject: CPSN New Solution Notification Mime-Version: 1.0 Content-Type: multipart/alternative; boundary=\"----=_Part_1_1399004.1144244105238\" </PRE> Dear Joerg Graf:</p> A SAP Business One partner has entered a new Solution Profile into the Channel Partner Solution Network.

 ('9740','Version One Ltd, United Kingdom - [9531]','711179','Automated Electronic Document Delivery','Automated Electronic Document Delivery - DbMail and DbFax DbMail DbMail is a set of tools for automated e-mailing. E-mails can be delivered as plain text or HTML e-mails, with or without attachments. DbMail works with Version One?s DbForm software to produce high quality professional looking documents, and then e-mails them in industry-standard formats such as PDF or TIFF. SMS gateways can be used to deliver text messages to mobile phones. DbMail normally runs in the background on a server using SMTP or MAPI to talk directly to the email server. This avoids the need for client software or manual intervention and this means that individual staff e-mails are not given out. DbFax DbFax is a server-based fax system, purpose-designed for automating the faxing of business documents. Various tools are provided to automate the generation of faxable images from business systems and office tools. DbFax integrates tightly with DbForm to ?auto-fax? documents such as purchase orders and remittances, directly from a company?s existing accounting and ERP systems. It also works with Version One?s document imaging software, DbArchive, to enable the faxing of archived documents without the need for additional desktop faxing solutions.

In use, DbForm is invisible to the end-user, but it adds considerable flexibility and functionality to the host system. DbForm is used as the core of many Version One solutions, not only for enhanced printing but also for automated emailing/faxing/archiving and e-Commerce. DbForm is also used as an integration tool ? automating conversions between XML, EDI and legacy text file formats. The application software takes raw data that would normally be sent to a printer from the core SAP business system, and then merges it with document templates, designed and individually formatted for each organisation. This then can be printed onto a laser printer, using plain A4 paper, to create sophisticated output files without the use of multipart or pre-printed stationery. The system can simultaneously send the same document to the document archive or, indeed, automatically fax it or send it via e-mail.',NULL,'mySAP All-in-One','4.6C, 4.7, 4.7C','2004 C','3+ reference customers','All - Cross Industry',NULL,'6-Not Applicable','9-Pending SAP Review',NULL,NULL,'South Africa, United Kingdom','50 to 100 employees , 100 to 250 employees , 250 to 500 employees , Over 500 employees','Logistics - Inventory Management, Logistics - Procurement, Logistics - Production, Logistics - Sales','English',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'400',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Yes',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'C','Windows XP/200X, Windows Server, Linux-Server, Linux-Desktop, HP-UX, IBM AIX, SGI Irix, Unix Freeform Version',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'No',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'5-Apr-06','Angela Slattery','Angela.Slattery','4/5/2006 8:44','Angela.Slattery','4/5/2006 8:44','Yes','<PRE> Return-Path: <system@ramius.net> Message-Id: <11505996.1144244105752.JavaMail.root@web011.sap.communityzero.com> Date: Wed, 5 Apr 2006 09:35:05 -0400 (EDT) From: null<system@ramius.net> To: joerg.graf@sap.com Subject: CPSN New Solution Notification Mime-Version: 1.0 Content-Type: multipart/alternative; boundary=\"----=_Part_3_27507852.1144244105750\" </PRE> Dear Joerg Graf:</p> A SAP Business One partner has entered a new Solution Profile into the Channel Partner Solution Network.

 ('9635','Version One Ltd, United Kingdom - [9531]','711179','Purchase Order Approval - DbAuthorise','DbAuthorise is Version One?s enterprise-wide Document Authorisation module. DbAuthorise enables the entire approval process to be streamlined. Simplifying the approval process reduces administration costs and errors. The reduction in paper chasing combined with a fully comprehensive audit trail, enables an increase in productivity, reductions in costs, improved company image and a fast return on investment. Users have implemented Version One?s authorisation software primarily because of its powerful functionality and its comprehensive licence structure. Numerous organisations are already benefiting from dramatic reductions in costs for both document storage and postage. In some organisations, there are hundreds of thousands of documents passing through the DbAuthorise system, and the software has the facility to ensure that purchase invoices are correctly authorised in accordance with each organisation?s stringent policies, and that payments are appropriately made. DbAuthorise may be used in conjunction with Version One?s other Document Management systems, allowing individual organisations to automate the authorisation processes involved. This means that users can now immediately retrieve documents electronically, and then automatically route these throughout the system to the relevant person.

 ('9634','Version One Ltd, United Kingdom - [9531]','711179','Purchase Invoice Automation','Using leading-edge, advanced Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technologies, Version One?s enterprise-wide automated capture technology automatically recognises supplier invoices, customer documents and many other documents, then intelligently highlights and extracts pertinent information. One of the most costly and time-consuming processes within any medium to large sized organisation, is the manual processing of supplier invoices. Preparation, input, validation, archiving - delays in executing these processes can be even more costly for an enterprise, often resulting in reduced supplier discounts and severe penalties incurred for late payments. The Version One solution can dramatically increase productivity within the finance department, as well as eliminating much of the traditional human error associated with these processes. This enhances the flow of information, allowing an organisation to optimize its accounting management. The system can validate extracted data against the accounting system and automatically highlight any discrepancies for intervention as appropriate. The Accounting or ERP system can then be populated accordingly, storing an electronic image in the archive. This system is fully scaleable, easy to implement and integrates fully with Version One?s end-to-end electronic document imaging and management solutions portfolio, seamlessly integrating into all the main Accounting and ERP systems.',NULL,'mySAP All-in-One','4.6C, 4.7, 4.7C','2004 A','Sold to more than one customer','All - Cross Industry, AEROSPACE & DEFENSE, AUTOMOTIVE, BANKING, Building

 ('9633','Version One Ltd, United Kingdom - [9531]',NULL,'DbArchive Document Imaging','Version One?s document imaging solution allows automatic document archiving, scanning and structured storage for easy retrieval and access and can be tailored to the specific requirements of an individual organisation. The software is tightly integrated into SAP systems. Using both the outgoing and incoming document archiving modules of DbArchive, all documents produced from an organisation?s business systems can be saved and indexed in a central document archive. This includes not only documents sourced from the business system but also from other applications including Microsoft Office ? for example e-mails, Word documents, faxes and more. Where appropriate, related documents are linked so that users can move from one document to the next in a natural document workflow. Using Version One?s software, authorised users can file, index, track, retrieve and distribute documents instantly from their desktop. Automatic links can be set between different document types. The system eliminates risk of document loss from mislaid or misfiled papers. Copies of documents can be retained at different locations for ultimate security, unlike traditional paper-archives. As prices of scanning and storage hardware have fallen substantially over recent years, this has brought document management and imaging software within the reach of even the smallest IT budget. Coupled with very fast Return-on-Investment - typically just a few months - this has significantly increased demand for Version One?s solutions.',NULL,'mySAP All-in-One','4.6C, 4.7, 4.7C','Not

 ('9372','Altec, United States - [11510]',NULL,'Doc-link','Altec?s doc-link? solution is an integrated document management solution for SAP Business One customers that streamlines paper-intensive processes. Doc-link seamlessly integrates with an organizations business systems to effectively reduce paper handling and improve business processes. Modular and tailored to each company?s requirements, doc-link captures all documents, streamlines approvals and reviews of documents using workflow and automatically routes and distributes printed documents based on recipient preferences. Doc-link repository brings documents indexed with the transaction data to be available from any desktop. Doc-link offers companies many advantages and can significantly leverage the investment they?ve made in their applications. The benefits provided can be summarized into three general categories: Increases productivity Reduces expenses Enhances customer service Doc-link suite of products is modular and scalable allowing smaller companies to ease imaging into their company at their pace. Doc-link automates vital paper-related business processes. Functional areas are: Capture - captures all documents external (those sent to the company or documents that were sent out and need to be recaptured with a signature) and documents generated by the applications. Captured documents are stored in the doc-link repository for retrieval from the desktop. Workflow ? configured to each company?s processes that move documents through the organization for reviews, approvals, etc. Routing ? automates the routing and distribution of forms and reports based on recipient preferences. Preferences include the method, format & schedule. A high level look of the entire system: Capture Two elements of capture- external and internal Documents can be captured coming into the business application by fax, email, file transfer, XML or EDI import, or manually scanned in. These documents are routed electronically to the appropriate electronic in-tray or queue for processing. ERM (Electronic Report Management) captures, indexes and stores all of the forms and reports generated by the business application. Workflow The workflow is fully configurable using ?a drag and drop? tool to streamline reviews and approvals processes or any process where documents are being moved between desktops. Workflow users do not need to be users of the business application. Approvals are accomplished through user-defined electronic rubber stamp and configured to each approver. Routing Automatically routes and distributes output from any application that prints. Output is automatically sent based on recipient preferences. Preferences includes method (email, fax, file transfer), format (TIF, CSV, XML, HTML, EDI) and schedule (immediate or batched and scheduled). Documents stored are configured to each company?s requirement. Documents are captured with transaction data or indexes. Also configured to each company are the organization or index levels within the repository. The retrieval of documents is accomplished by the indexes stored with each image. The indexes are tailored to each client?s requirements for retrieval. The ability to retrieve related documents is accomplished by a common index. Through a combination of ERM, auto, retro and manual indexing features, all documents are electronically linked together for paperless archival, retrieval and routing Every form and report captured by the ERM process is stored and indexed to its each image. The retro indexing feature of doc-link provides for indexes to be stored for documents not available at the time of capture. For example, when checks are printed, the check number and check date are retro- indexed to all invoices paid by that check. This enables the invoices to be retrieved by check number and check to be retrieved by invoice number. The Bar Code feature enables a bar code to be printed on any document with any key data property (ie, order #, work order #, project #, job #, etc) for documents that need to be signed and capture. The signed document is scanned and doc-link reads the bar code and Auto indexes the document with the any data properties from any application on the server automatically. Through indexing, doc-link can link related documents together, even from various applications that may not be integrated.',NULL,'SAP Business One','Not applicable','2004 A, 2005 A, 6.5, 2004 B, 7.0, 7.1, 2004 C, 7.5, 7.6','3+ reference customers','All - Cross Industry',NULL,'1-Qualified / Certified / Reviewed','9-Pending SAP Review','7-May-06','7-May-06','Global','Under 50 employees , 50 to 100 employees , 100 to 250 employees , 250 to 500 employees , Over 500 employees','Customer Relationship Management - Activities Management, Customer Relationship Management - Calendar, Customer Relationship Management - Opportunity Management, Customer Relationship Management - Service Management, Customization - Analysis Tools, Customization - Extension & Personalization, Customization - Formatted Search, Customization - Migration, Customization - Support Tools, Customization - User Defined Object, Financials - Banking, Financials - Basel II, Financials - Cost Accounting, Financials - General Ledger, Financials - Tax, Human Resources - Employee Data Management, Human Resources - Payroll, Implementation - Alert & Workflow Management, Implementation - Application Integration, Implementation - Financial Initialization, Implementation - General Settings, Implementation - Getting Started, Logistics - Internet Sales, Logistics - Inventory Management, Logistics - Procurement, Logistics - Production, Logistics - Sales, Software Development Kit - Data Interface API, Software Development Kit - Data Interface Server, Software Development Kit - User Interface API','English','1','14','40','0','2','6','300','1','1000','3','25','1','3','www.altec-inc.com','Yes','United States','12','12','5','5','1','1','10','10','10','10','Concurrent','Yes','.Net','Windows XP/200X, Windows Server','Microsoft SQL','Yes','Yes',NULL,NULL,'No',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'25-Jan-06',NULL,'Mark Tague','1/25/2006 13:43','CPSN Administrator','1/25/2006 13:43','Yes','<PRE> Return-Path: <system@ramius.net> Message-Id: <4222636.1138218020733.JavaMail.root@web008.ramius.net.sap.communityzero.com> Date: Wed, 25 Jan 2006 14:40:20 -0500 (EST) From: SAP Reference Program for Channel Partners<system@ramius.net> To: joseph.carroll@sap.com Subject: CPSN New Solution Notification Mime-Version: 1.0 Content-Type: multipart/alternative; boundary=\"----=_Part_16_6548626.1138218020732\" </PRE> Dear Joseph Carroll:</p> A SAP Business One partner has entered a new Solution Profile into the Channel Partner Solution Network.

Smilehouse OpenSyncro is a lightweight, open source enterprise application integration (EAI) tool written in Java language. Modern ERP solutions are becoming increasingly integrated to other IT systems to enable more efficient processes, partner integration and future growth. OpenSyncro enables building these integrations. The built-in components offer basic functionality to transfer and transform data. This functionality can be used for instance to extract CSV-data file from a FTP-server, transforming the CSV file to XML format and finally loading the XML file to desired location through HTTP. OpenSyncro has a commercial Connector Pack for SAP Business One. It enables integrating SAP Business One to other enterprise applications easily and as such facilitates using SAP Business One as the backbone of advanced e-business solutions. OpenSyncro was originally developed for connecting e-commerce software Smilehouse Workspace to SAP Business One, but it can be used independently for integrations between other applications, as well as for various data conversion tasks.

 (9372,NULL,'Doc-link','Altec?s doc-link? solution is an integrated document management solution for SAP Business One customers that streamlines paper-intensive processes. Doc-link seamlessly integrates with an organizations business systems to effectively reduce paper handling and improve business processes. Modular and tailored to each company?s requirements, doc-link captures all documents, streamlines approvals and reviews of documents using workflow and automatically routes and distributes printed documents based on recipient preferences. Doc-link repository brings documents indexed with the transaction data to be available from any desktop. Doc-link offers companies many advantages and can significantly leverage the investment they?ve made in their applications. The benefits provided can be summarized into three general categories: Increases productivity Reduces expenses Enhances customer service Doc-link suite of products is modular and scalable allowing smaller companies to ease imaging into their company at their pace. Doc-link automates vital paper-related business processes. Functional areas are: Capture - captures all documents external (those sent to the company or documents that were sent out and need to be recaptured with a signature) and documents generated by the applications. Captured documents are stored in the doc-link repository for retrieval from the desktop. Workflow ? configured to each company?s processes that move documents through the organization for reviews, approvals, etc. Routing ? automates the routing and distribution of forms and reports based on recipient preferences. Preferences include the method, format & schedule. A high level look of the entire system: Capture Two elements of capture- external and internal Documents can be captured coming into the business application by fax, email, file transfer, XML or EDI import, or manually scanned in. These documents are routed electronically to the appropriate electronic in-tray or queue for processing. ERM (Electronic Report Management) captures, indexes and stores all of the forms and reports generated by the business application. Workflow The workflow is fully configurable using ?a drag and drop? tool to streamline reviews and approvals processes or any process where documents are being moved between desktops. Workflow users do not need to be users of the business application. Approvals are accomplished through user-defined electronic rubber stamp and configured to each approver. Routing Automatically routes and distributes output from any application that prints. Output is automatically sent based on recipient preferences. Preferences includes method (email, fax, file transfer), format (TIF, CSV, XML, HTML, EDI) and schedule (immediate or batched and scheduled). Documents stored are configured to each company?s requirement. Documents are captured with transaction data or indexes. Also configured to each company are the organization or index levels within the repository. The retrieval of documents is accomplished by the indexes stored with each image. The indexes are tailored to each client?s requirements for retrieval. The ability to retrieve related documents is accomplished by a common index. Through a combination of ERM, auto, retro and manual indexing features, all documents are electronically linked together for paperless archival, retrieval and routing Every form and report captured by the ERM process is stored and indexed to its each image. The retro indexing feature of doc-link provides for indexes to be stored for documents not available at the time of capture. For example, when checks are printed, the check number and check date are retro- indexed to all invoices paid by that check. This enables the invoices to be retrieved by check number and check to be retrieved by invoice number. The Bar Code feature enables a bar code to be printed on any document with any key data property (ie, order #, work order #, project #, job #, etc) for documents that need to be signed and capture. The signed document is scanned and doc-link reads the bar code and Auto indexes the document with the any data properties from any application on the server automatically. Through indexing, doc-link can link related documents together, even from various applications that may not be integrated.',NULL,NULL,'2006-05-07 00:00:00','2006-05-07 00:00:00',1,14,40,0,2,6,300,1,1000,3,25,1,3,'www.altec-inc.com','Yes',12,12,5,5,1,1,10,10,10,10,'Yes','Microsoft SQL','Yes','Yes','','No','','',NULL,'','2006-01-25 00:00:00','','Mark Tague','2006-01-25 13:43:00','CPSN Administrator','2006-01-25 13:43:00','Yes',11510,5,5,5,5,5,5,'<PRE> Return-Path: <system@ramius.net> Message-Id: <4222636.1138218020733.JavaMail.root@web008.ramius.net.sap.communityzero.com> Date: Wed, 25 Jan 2006 14:40:20 -0500 (EST) From: SAP Reference Program for Channel Partners<system@ramius.net> To: joseph.carroll@sap.com Subject: CPSN New Solution Notification Mime-Version: 1.0 Content-Type: multipart/alternative; boundary=\"----=_Part_16_6548626.1138218020732\" </PRE> Dear Joseph Carroll:</p> A SAP Business One partner has entered a new Solution Profile into the Channel Partner Solution Network.

This includes not only documents sourced from the business system but also from other applications including Microsoft Office ? for example e-mails, Word documents, faxes and more. Where appropriate, related documents are linked so that users can move from one document to the next in a natural document workflow. Using Version One?s software, authorised users can file, index, track, retrieve and distribute documents instantly from their desktop. Automatic links can be set between different document types. The system eliminates risk of document loss from mislaid or misfiled papers. Copies of documents can be retained at different locations for ultimate security, unlike traditional paper-archives.

Preparation, input, validation, archiving - delays in executing these processes can be even more costly for an enterprise, often resulting in reduced supplier discounts and severe penalties incurred for late payments. The Version One solution can dramatically increase productivity within the finance department, as well as eliminating much of the traditional human error associated with these processes. This enhances the flow of information, allowing an organisation to optimize its accounting management. The system can validate extracted data against the accounting system and automatically highlight any discrepancies for intervention as appropriate.

The reduction in paper chasing combined with a fully comprehensive audit trail, enables an increase in productivity, reductions in costs, improved company image and a fast return on investment. Users have implemented Version One?s authorisation software primarily because of its powerful functionality and its comprehensive licence structure. Numerous organisations are already benefiting from dramatic reductions in costs for both document storage and postage. In some organisations, there are hundreds of thousands of documents passing through the DbAuthorise system, and the software has the facility to ensure that purchase invoices are correctly authorised in accordance with each organisation?s stringent policies, and that payments are appropriately made. DbAuthorise may be used in conjunction with Version One?s other Document Management systems, allowing individual organisations to automate the authorisation processes involved. This means that users can now immediately retrieve documents electronically, and then automatically route these throughout the system to the relevant person. DbAuthorise works seamlessly and invisibly, because of its tight integration SAP systems.',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,25,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Yes',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Yes','','','','','No','','',NULL,'','2006-03-14 00:00:00','Angela Slattery','Angela.Slattery','2006-03-14 09:45:00','Angela.Slattery','2006-03-14 09:45:00','Yes',9531,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'<PRE> Return-Path: <system@ramius.net> Message-Id: <6586859.1142352266374.JavaMail.root@web011.sap.communityzero.com> Date: Tue, 14 Mar 2006 11:04:26 -0500 (EST) From: null<system@ramius.net> To: joerg.graf@sap.com Subject: CPSN New Solution Notification Mime-Version: 1.0 Content-Type: multipart/alternative; boundary=\"----=_Part_4_5285010.1142352266372\" </PRE> Dear Joerg Graf:</p> A SAP Business One partner has entered a new Solution Profile into the Channel Partner Solution Network.

E-mails can be delivered as plain text or HTML e-mails, with or without attachments. DbMail works with Version One?s DbForm software to produce high quality professional looking documents, and then e-mails them in industry-standard formats such as PDF or TIFF. SMS gateways can be used to deliver text messages to mobile phones. DbMail normally runs in the background on a server using SMTP or MAPI to talk directly to the email server. This avoids the need for client software or manual intervention and this means that individual staff e-mails are not given out. DbFax DbFax is a server-based fax system, purpose-designed for automating the faxing of business documents. Various tools are provided to automate the generation of faxable images from business systems and office tools. DbFax integrates tightly with DbForm to ?auto-fax? documents such as purchase orders and remittances, directly from a company?s existing accounting and ERP systems. It also works with Version One?s document imaging software, DbArchive, to enable the faxing of archived documents without the need for additional desktop faxing solutions.

 (9741,'711179','Secure Cheque Printing Solution','Secure Cheque Printing Solution The Version One Secure Cheque Printing Solution consists of an output management system and a specially adapted laser printer with additional security features. The printer uses MICR toner so that even the magnetic numbering on the cheques can be added at print time. The cheque stationery can be produced to your precise specifications, by a specialist cheque printing company. The range of anti-fraud devices incorporated into the stationery exceeds the requirements of APACS (the UK banking standards body). Apart from a logo, watermark and hologram, the cheques are effectively blank, so the same stationery may be used for any number of bank accounts with multiple banks. With most applications, the Version One software is invisible to the end-user. Cheques are produced either by printing the standard accounting system output to a new ?virtual? printer on the network or by generating a file containing the details for the cheque in a designated directory on the network. DbChequePrint runs ?behind the scenes? on the server to reformat the standard output, to add graphics, etc and to direct the output to the appropriate printer(s). There is usually no need for any manual intervention. The special fonts and any signatures will normally be stored inside the printer itself and will not be available on the network, even to administrators. No software, fonts or printer devices are required to be installed on client PCs for users to be able to print cheques. For reasons of security, DbForm does not allow any ad hoc cheque printing outside of the core applications. For more complex requirements, DbChequePrint incorporates a sophisticated programming environment, which allows the standard output to be reformatted. For example: cheques may be pre-sorted prior to printing, e.g. high value cheques printed separately. High-value cheques may be printed with one signature and a dotted line or no signature at all so that they may be manually signed. Cheques may be routed to different printers or stationery, e.g. low-value cheques to pressure-seal stationery, high-value to standard A4 sheets. The continuation pages of remittance advices may use a different layout and/or different stationery from a different paper tray or a different printer. Activity reports can be automatically sent to other printers. Output may be automatically archived to Version One?s DbArchive or other document management system (the cheque portion can be voided or omitted completely from the archived document). The DbChequePrint system may be used - with no additional software costs - to generate other documents from your SAP finance systems or other software, such as payroll. For example, hundreds of our customers use the same software to generate BACS remittance advices, Giro credits, purchase orders, invoices and credit notes, debtor statements, reminder letters, direct debit mandates and customised reports.','www.versionone.co.uk',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,100,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Yes',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'','','','','','No','','',NULL,'','2006-04-05 00:00:00','','Angela.Slattery','2006-04-05 09:28:00','Angela.Slattery','2006-04-05 09:28:00','Yes',9531,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'<PRE> Return-Path: <system@ramius.net> Message-Id: <24970181.1144244105242.JavaMail.root@web011.sap.communityzero.com> Date: Wed, 5 Apr 2006 09:35:05 -0400 (EDT) From: null<system@ramius.net> To: joerg.graf@sap.com Subject: CPSN New Solution Notification Mime-Version: 1.0 Content-Type: multipart/alternative; boundary=\"----=_Part_1_1399004.1144244105238\" </PRE> Dear Joerg Graf:</p> A SAP Business One partner has entered a new Solution Profile into the Channel Partner Solution Network.

Secure electronic funds transfer is of ultimate importance for any organisation today, and peace of mind comes from having secure, efficient systems, which ensure that fraud is eliminated. Tightly integrated into SAP, DbBACS is highly secure, proven and very easy to use. Automated electronic payments and collections include: ? Supplier payments ? Salaries & wages ? Direct debits Improved Business Efficiency DbBACS users report greatly increased efficiency throughout the organisation, as traditional methods of funds transfer are now streamlined by using e-commerce solutions. A true multi-user system, DbBACS enables any number of authorised users to process BACS transmissions directly from their own desktop. Time Savings Substantial time savings are achieved, with no more cheques to print, sign or post. Just a few mouse-clicks and all payments, etc. will be automatically sent electronically - in seconds. For easier reconciliation, only one entry per transmission appears on the bank statement. Cost Savings Vastly reduce administrative and management costs, as well as bank charges. Postage and handling costs are eliminated, as is expensive pre-printed cheque stationery. As a result of implementing DbBACS, users find it much easier to negotiate increased supplier discounts because of more efficient funds transfer. For multi-site organisations, authorised users can submit BACS transmissions through one central BACS server engine - dramatically reducing costs whilst providing greater security and simplifying support. Security Eliminating cheques also eliminates the possibility of internal and external cheque fraud. Vastly improve security by restricting access to confidential & sensitive information. User-profiling offers the facility to enable one user to prepare a submission, one to queue it ready for transmission and yet another to action it with a BACS password. The system automatically blocks transmissions where individual record or transmission totals exceed pre-defined values for the specified profile. Full audit trails are provided for total peace of mind. Fast Payback The dramatic savings in transaction charges, stationery and labour costs mean that DbBACS typically pays for itself in just a few months. Automatically sending out the associated remittance advices with other products from Version One\' s suite of e-business software modules - DbFax and DbMail - will provide even greater savings. Tightly integrated into SAP Accounting and ERP systems, DbBACS offers the following: ? Available on UNIX, Windows NT and Windows 2000 platforms. ?
